# elec5305-project-510044280

This project aims to develop a deepfake speech detection system using Python (signal processing and machine learning), with its main function being to identify wether an input sample is genuinely human or a spoof (AI-generated or a recording) which will serve as defense against voice spoofing attacks. The approach will combine spectral features (MFCCs, spectrograms) with lightweight neural classifiers to identify subtle artifacts left by generative models and the evaluation will be based on the ASVspoof 2019 dataset \cite{wang2020asvspoof2019largescalepublic}; which is a benchmark corpus for audio anti-spoofing.
