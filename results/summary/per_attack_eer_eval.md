## 📌 Interpretation

- **LFCC + GMM** performs strongest on attacks with high-frequency artefacts (A07–A09, A16).
- **MFCC + GMM** is sometimes more stable across a wider range of attacks.
- **CNN models** show large variance across attacks:
  - perform very well on some (A07, A09, A16)
  - but fail strongly on others (A12, A13, A18–A19)
- **A17 and A19** are difficult across *all* systems — matching known ASVspoof benchmarks.

These detailed results support the analysis given in the report and demonstrate clear model behaviour differences across spoofing systems.
